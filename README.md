# How Much Is A Freddo (HMIAF)
"How Much is a Freddo" (HMIAF) is a little system that scrapes UK supermarket websites for the cheapest price on the best chocolate known to man, the [Freddo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddo). But really it's a way for me to learn [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and it's technologies.

## Backend Technologies

 - Amazon EC2 instance with Apache, MySQL and PHP. (t2.micro used for development)
 - Amazon Aurora or an RDBMS of your choice.
 - Python 3 with the following dependencies (built on these versions)
    - [Tweepy 3.10.0](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
    - [Beautiful Soup 4.9.3](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
    - [Requests 2.25.1](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
